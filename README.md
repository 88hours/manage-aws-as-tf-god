# Create an AWS Organization Admin
- **managment-account/create-aws-org-admin.tf**  

Terraform uses the environment variable `AWS_PROFILE` to select which AWS credentials profile to use.

This repository contains Terraform code to provision an AWS IAM user with administrative permissions for AWS Organizations, along with access keys.


## Security

- The `terraform.tfvars` file is ignored by Git (see `.gitignore`) to help prevent accidental commits of sensitive data.

## TODO
- Passwords for the login profile are generated by AWS and can be encrypted with a PGP key if desired.
