# Create an AWS Delegated Admin Management Account

# Create an AWS Organization Admin Module **managment-account/create-aws-org-admin.tf**  

Terraform uses the environment variable `AWS_PROFILE` to select which AWS credentials profile to use.

This repository contains Terraform code to provision an AWS IAM user with administrative permissions for AWS Organizations, along with access keys.

You need to run this from a delegated admin account.

After creation, log in to the Org admin account, enable MFA, and reset the password.

## Security

- The `terraform.tfvars` file is ignored by Git (see `.gitignore`) to help prevent accidental commits of sensitive data.

## TODO
- Passwords for the login profile are generated by AWS and can be encrypted with a PGP key if desired.
